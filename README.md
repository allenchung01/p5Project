Use the left arrow to swap to a circle, use the right arrow to swap to a square.
Click and drag to draw. Every time the bouncing square hits a wall, the color of its trail and the border of your drawing tool change fade to a random color. The background is also a random color. If you draw at the top of the box, the fill will be black, fading to white as you draw closer to the bottom of the box. I couldn't get the still image to show up, but I left the code for it in but commented the image() line out.
